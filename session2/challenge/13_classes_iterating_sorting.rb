# Define a class called User that keeps track of a person's username
# it should receive the username when initialized
# it should have a method add_blog which accepts a date and text
# it should have a method blogs which returns an array of all blogs the user has written
# they should be in reverse chronological order (newest first)
#
# Define a class called Blog that could be used to store an entry for your web log.
# The class should have a getter and setter methods: text , date , user
# its initialize method should receive the date, user , and text
# have a method called summary that returns the first 10 words from the text (or the entire text if it is less than 10 words)
#
# Two blogs should be equal to eachother if they have the same user, date, and text
# here is a partially filled out example of how to define the == operator:
#      def ==(other)
#        return self.date == other.date
#      end
